# Overview of the statistical analysis
Higher temperatures mean more beach goers. More beach goers means more potential customers for the Surf Shop / Ice cream parlor. December is a low month for foot traffic on the beach. We are comparing it to a high traffic month to get a feel for expectations.
## Results:
* December has a wider range of temperature, but lower overall.
* June has a left/negative skew standard deviation, meaning more warm days.
* December has a right/positive standard deviation, meaning more chilly days.

## Summary:

Generally speaking, we can expect that ice cream sales will be lower in cooler months like December, but precipitation and vacation rental data will be a far better indicator for expected sales. While we can certainly make some generalized estimates on beach traffic based on temperature, it is not a good indicator by itself as the deviation is relatively low between the 2 months, and most surf afficianados are more than comfortable wearing a wetsuit to keep surfing in colder temps.
